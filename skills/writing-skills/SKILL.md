# Writing Skills

## Overview

**Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation.**

**Personal skills live in agent-specific directories (`~/.claude/skills` for Claude Code, `~/.agents/skills/` for Codex)** 

You write test cases (pressure scenarios with subagents), watch them fail (baseline behavior), write the skill (documentation), watch tests pass (agents comply), and refactor (close loopholes).

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill, you don't know if the skill teaches the right thing.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** You MUST understand superpowers:test-driven-development before using this skill. That skill defines the fundamental RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. This skill adapts TDD to documentation.

**Official guidance:** For Anthropic's official skill authoring best practices, see anthropic-best-practices.md. This document provides additional patterns and guidelines that complement the TDD-focused approach in this skill.

## What is a Skill?

A **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools. Skills help future Claude instances find and apply effective approaches.

**Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides

**Skills are NOT:** Narratives about how you solved a problem once

## TDD Mapping for Skills

| TDD Concept | Skill Creation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Test case** | Pressure scenario with subagent |
| **Production code** | Skill document (SKILL.md) |
| **Test fails (RED)** | Agent violates rule without skill (baseline) |
| **Test passes (GREEN)** | Agent complies with skill present |
| **Refactor** | Close loopholes while maintaining compliance |
| **Write test first** | Run baseline scenario BEFORE writing skill |
| **Watch it fail** | Document exact rationalizations agent uses |
| **Minimal code** | Write skill addressing those specific violations |
| **Watch it pass** | Verify agent now complies |
| **Refactor cycle** | Find new rationalizations → plug → re-verify |

The entire skill creation process follows RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.

## When to Create a Skill

**Create when:**
- Technique wasn't intuitively obvious to you
- You'd reference this again across projects
- Pattern applies broadly (not project-specific)
- Others would benefit

**Don't create for:**
- One-off solutions
- Standard practices well-documented elsewhere
- Project-specific conventions (put in CLAUDE.md)
- Mechanical constraints (if it's enforceable with regex/validation, automate it—save documentation for judgment calls)

## Directory Structure


```
skills/
  skill-name/
    SKILL.md              # Main reference (required)
    supporting-file.*     # Only if needed
```

**Flat namespace** - all skills in one searchable namespace

**Separate files for:**
1. **Heavy reference** (100+ lines) - API docs, comprehensive syntax
2. **Reusable tools** - Scripts, utilities, templates

**Keep inline:**
- Principles and concepts
- Code patterns (< 50 lines)
- Everything else

## SKILL.md Structure

**Frontmatter (YAML):** full field inventory in `creating-tools/frontmatter-reference.md`.

- **All fields are optional.** Only `description` is recommended, so Claude knows when to use
  the skill. `name` defaults to the directory name.
- `description`: Third-person. **What the skill does and when to use it** — both.
  - Include specific symptoms, situations, and contexts
  - **NEVER summarize the skill's internal steps or workflow** (see CSO section for why)
  - Put the key use case first: combined `description` + `when_to_use` is truncated at 1,536
    characters in the skill listing
- If the skill must run in a cloud session or routine, restrict frontmatter to the six
  packaging-spec fields — anything else is a hard upload error. See the reference.

name: skill-name-with-hyphens

## Claude Search Optimization (CSO)

**Critical for discovery:** Future Claude needs to FIND your skill

### 1. Rich Description Field

**Purpose:** Claude reads description to decide which skills to load for a given task. Make it answer: "Should I read this skill right now?"

**Format:** State the capability, then the trigger — official guidance is *"what the skill does
and when to use it."* A description with no trigger context is the most common cause of a skill
never auto-activating.

**CRITICAL: Capability belongs in the description. Procedure does not.**

The line to hold is not *what it does* vs *when to use it* — you need both. It is **capability**
vs **internal steps**.

**Why this matters:** Testing revealed that when a description summarizes the skill's *workflow*,
Claude may follow the description instead of reading the full skill content. A description saying
"code review between tasks" caused Claude to do ONE review, even though the skill's flowchart
clearly showed TWO reviews (spec compliance then code quality).

**The trap:** a description that narrates *how* the skill works creates a shortcut Claude takes.
The skill body becomes documentation Claude skips. A description that names *what the skill is
for* does not — it makes the skill findable, which is the field's entire job.

| Content | Example | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Capability** — what it is for | "Executes an implementation plan task-by-task in isolated contexts" | Keep |
| **Procedure** — the steps it runs | "dispatches subagent per task with code review between tasks" | Remove |

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Narrates internal steps - Claude follows this instead of reading the skill
description: Use when executing plans - dispatches subagent per task with code review between tasks

# ❌ BAD: Enumerates the process
description: Use for TDD - write test first, watch it fail, write minimal code, refactor

# ❌ BAD: Trigger only, no capability - harder to match, tells Claude nothing about fit
description: Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session

# ✅ GOOD: Capability + trigger, no procedure
description: Executes an implementation plan in isolated per-task contexts. Use when you have a written plan with independent tasks.

# ✅ GOOD: Capability + trigger
description: Requires a failing test before implementation code. Use when implementing any feature or bugfix.
```

**Content:**
- Use concrete triggers, symptoms, and situations that signal this skill applies
- Describe the *problem* (race conditions, inconsistent behavior) not *language-specific symptoms* (setTimeout, sleep)
- Keep triggers technology-agnostic unless the skill itself is technology-specific
- If skill is technology-specific, make that explicit in the trigger
- Write in third person (injected into system prompt)
- State the capability alongside the trigger — **never the internal steps**

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Too abstract, vague, doesn't include when to use
description: For async testing

# ❌ BAD: First person
description: I can help you with async tests when they're flaky

# ❌ BAD: Mentions technology but skill isn't specific to it
description: Use when tests use setTimeout/sleep and are flaky

# ✅ GOOD: Starts with "Use when", describes problem, no workflow
description: Use when tests have race conditions, timing dependencies, or pass/fail inconsistently

# ✅ GOOD: Technology-specific skill with explicit trigger
description: Use when using React Router and handling authentication redirects
```

### 2. Keyword Coverage

Use words Claude would search for:
- Error messages: "Hook timed out", "ENOTEMPTY", "race condition"
- Symptoms: "flaky", "hanging", "zombie", "pollution"
- Synonyms: "timeout/hang/freeze", "cleanup/teardown/afterEach"
- Tools: Actual commands, library names, file types

### 3. Descriptive Naming

**Use active voice, verb-first:**
- ✅ `creating-skills` not `skill-creation`
- ✅ `condition-based-waiting` not `async-test-helpers`

### 4. Token Efficiency (Critical)

**Problem:** getting-started and frequently-referenced skills load into EVERY conversation. Every token counts.

**Target word counts:**
- getting-started workflows: <150 words each
- Frequently-loaded skills: <200 words total
- Other skills: <500 words (still be concise)

**Techniques:**

**Move details to tool help:**
```bash
# ❌ BAD: Document all flags in SKILL.md
search-conversations supports --text, --both, --after DATE, --before DATE, --limit N

# ✅ GOOD: Reference --help
search-conversations supports multiple modes and filters. Run --help for details.
```

**Use cross-references:**
```markdown
# ❌ BAD: Repeat workflow details
When searching, dispatch subagent with template...
[20 lines of repeated instructions]

# ✅ GOOD: Reference other skill
Always use subagents (50-100x context savings). REQUIRED: Use [other-skill-name] for workflow.
```

**Compress examples:**
```markdown
# ❌ BAD: Verbose example (42 words)
your human partner: "How did we handle authentication errors in React Router before?"
You: I'll search past conversations for React Router authentication patterns.
[Dispatch subagent with search query: "React Router authentication error handling 401"]

# ✅ GOOD: Minimal example (20 words)
Partner: "How did we handle auth errors in React Router?"
You: Searching...
[Dispatch subagent → synthesis]
```

**Eliminate redundancy:**
- Don't repeat what's in cross-referenced skills
- Don't explain what's obvious from command
- Don't include multiple examples of same pattern

**Verification:**
```bash
wc -w skills/path/SKILL.md
# getting-started workflows: aim for <150 each
# Other frequently-loaded: aim for <200 total
```

**Name by what you DO or core insight:**
- ✅ `condition-based-waiting` > `async-test-helpers`
- ✅ `using-skills` not `skill-usage`
- ✅ `flatten-with-flags` > `data-structure-refactoring`
- ✅ `root-cause-tracing` > `debugging-techniques`

**Gerunds (-ing) work well for processes:**
- `creating-skills`, `testing-skills`, `debugging-with-logs`
- Active, describes the action you're taking

### 4. Cross-Referencing Other Skills

**When writing documentation that references other skills:**

Use skill name only, with explicit requirement markers:
- ✅ Good: `**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:test-driven-development`
- ✅ Good: `**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** You MUST understand superpowers:systematic-debugging`
- ❌ Bad: `See skills/testing/test-driven-development` (unclear if required)
- ❌ Bad: `@skills/testing/test-driven-development/SKILL.md` (force-loads, burns context)

**Why no @ links:** `@` syntax force-loads files immediately, consuming 200k+ context before you need them.

## Code Examples

**One excellent example beats many mediocre ones**

Choose most relevant language:
- Testing techniques → TypeScript/JavaScript
- System debugging → Shell/Python
- Data processing → Python

**Good example:**
- Complete and runnable
- Well-commented explaining WHY
- From real scenario
- Shows pattern clearly
- Ready to adapt (not generic template)

**Don't:**
- Implement in 5+ languages
- Create fill-in-the-blank templates
- Write contrived examples

You're good at porting - one great example is enough.

## File Organization

### Self-Contained Skill
```
defense-in-depth/
  SKILL.md    # Everything inline
```
When: All content fits, no heavy reference needed

### Skill with Reusable Tool
```
condition-based-waiting/
  SKILL.md    # Overview + patterns
  example.ts  # Working helpers to adapt
```
When: Tool is reusable code, not just narrative

### Skill with Heavy Reference
```
pptx/
  SKILL.md       # Overview + workflows
  pptxgenjs.md   # 600 lines API reference
  ooxml.md       # 500 lines XML structure
  scripts/       # Executable tools
```
When: Reference material too large for inline

## The Iron Law (Same as TDD)

```
NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

This applies to NEW skills AND EDITS to existing skills.

Write skill before testing? Delete it. Start over.
Edit skill without testing? Same violation.

**No exceptions:**
- Not for "simple additions"
- Not for "just adding a section"
- Not for "documentation updates"
- Don't keep untested changes as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" while running tests
- Delete means delete

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** The superpowers:test-driven-development skill explains why this matters. Same principles apply to documentation.

## TDD Methodology

Full methodology (pressure scenarios, rationalization tables, Iron Law, worked example) is in
`eval-methodology.md` in this directory. Read it alongside this skill when creating a new skill.

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Narrative Example
"In session 2025-10-03, we found empty projectDir caused..."
**Why bad:** Too specific, not reusable

### ❌ Multi-Language Dilution
example-js.js, example-py.py, example-go.go
**Why bad:** Mediocre quality, maintenance burden

### ❌ Code in Flowcharts
```dot
step1 [label="import fs"];
step2 [label="read file"];
```
**Why bad:** Can't copy-paste, hard to read

### ❌ Generic Labels
helper1, helper2, step3, pattern4
**Why bad:** Labels should have semantic meaning

## Phase 3 — Pulser Eval

See `eval-methodology.md` for the full Pulser usage guide, eval.yaml format, steps, and fallback path.

## Skill Creation Checklist (TDD Adapted)

See `eval-methodology.md` for the full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR checklist, Pulser eval steps, and quality checks.

## Discovery Workflow

Problem → finds description → scans overview → reads patterns → loads example. Put searchable terms early and often.

## The Bottom Line

**Creating skills IS TDD for process documentation.**

Same Iron Law. Same RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. Same benefits. If you follow TDD for code, follow it for skills.

## Gotchas

1. No skill without a failing test first — the Iron Law. If you wrote the skill before the baseline test, delete it and start over.
2. Route all skill creation through `creating-tools` — do not invoke this skill directly from user intent.
3. The Pulser check is a floor, not a ceiling — passing Pulser means the skill is structurally correct, not that it works.
