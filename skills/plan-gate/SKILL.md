# Plan Gate

## Overview

Bridge between planning and execution. Automatically invoked at the end of writing-plans. Runs the plan through a mandatory gate sequence before any implementation begins.

**Trigger:** Automatically invoked after writing-plans saves a plan doc. Can also be invoked manually.

**Input:** Path to a completed plan doc at `plans/<slug>/<slug>-plan.md`.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the plan-gate skill to gate this plan before execution."

## Project Config Check

Before running the gate sequence, read `project.json` at the repo root if it exists:

```bash
cat "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/project.json" 2>/dev/null
```

The `git rev-parse` anchor ensures the read works regardless of the orchestrator's current working directory. If the command returns nothing (file absent or not in a git repo), all flags default to enabled.

Apply these overrides:

| Field | Value | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `workflow.architect-review` | `false` | Skip Step 1 (Architect Review) entirely — proceed directly to Step 2 |
| `workflow.plan-gate` | `false` | Skip the entire gate sequence — hand off directly to executing-plans |
| `workflow.tdd` | `false` | Skip Step 3 (Test Builder) — proceed directly to Step 4 after checkpoint |
| `jira.enabled` | `false` | Skip Step 4 (Jira Ticket Creation) — proceed directly to Step 5 |
| absent / true | — | Run full gate sequence as defined |

## Gate Sequence

### Step 1 — Architect Review

Dispatch the `architect` agent with `subagent_type: architect` and the plan doc path.

**On NEEDS REVISION:**
- BLOCKING items requiring user judgment → surface verbatim, wait, update plan doc, re-invoke architect
- BLOCKING items resolvable from context → fix inline, re-invoke architect
- Maximum 3 rounds. If BLOCKING items remain after round 3, surface to the user and stop.

**On APPROVED** → proceed to Step 2.

---

### Step 2 — Test Strategy

Dispatch the `test-strategy` agent with the plan doc path.

The agent appends a `## Testing Plan` section to the plan doc. No output is needed back to the main context — the agent writes directly to the plan doc.

---

### Checkpoint — Human Approval Required

After Step 2 completes, surface the Testing Plan to the user:

> "Test strategy is complete. Review the `## Testing Plan` section in `plans/<slug>/<slug>-plan.md` before I proceed with test builder, Jira ticket creation, and TODO.md registration. Reply 'proceed' to continue."

**Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding to Step 3.** Do not proceed automatically.

---

### Step 3 — Test Builder

**TDD-disabled check:** if `project.json` has `workflow.tdd: false`, skip this step entirely and proceed directly to Step 4. No warning, no error.

Otherwise: dispatch the `test-builder` agent with the plan doc path.

The agent reads the `## Testing Plan` section and writes failing tests to disk. Tests exist on disk before any implementation begins.

Proceed to Step 4 when the agent completes.

---

### Step 4 — Jira Ticket Creation

**Jira-disabled check:** if `project.json` has `jira.enabled: false` (or the file is absent), skip this step entirely and proceed directly to Step 5. No warning, no error. The Task Reference table's "Jira Key" column remains blank.

Otherwise: invoke the `jira-workflow-manager` agent to create the Epic and Tasks from the Task Reference table in the plan doc.

Pass the agent:
- The plan doc path
- The Task Reference table rows (task names, sizes, scope)

The agent assigns Jira keys and writes them back into the Task Reference table rows in the plan doc. The Epic key goes into the plan doc header.

---

### Step 5 — TODO.md Registration

Invoke the `plan-management` skill:
- `plan-doc`: `plans/<slug>/<slug>-plan.md`
- `status`: `created`
- `jira-key`: the Epic key assigned in Step 4 — **omit this argument entirely if Jira is disabled**

---

## Handoff

After all 5 steps complete successfully:

> "Plan gated and ready. Invoke executing-plans with `plans/<slug>/<slug>-plan.md` to begin."

---

## Error Handling

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Architect returns NEEDS REVISION (rounds 1–2) | Fix/surface issues, re-invoke architect |
| Architect returns NEEDS REVISION after round 3 | Surface to user, stop |
| Any agent fails or is unavailable | Surface the failure, stop — do not skip a gate step |
| Plan doc missing required sections | Surface what is missing, stop |

Never skip a gate step (unless explicitly disabled via `project.json`). If an agent is unavailable, surface the blocker to the user.

## Integration

**Called by:**
- `writing-plans` — automatically at end of skill

**Calls:**
- `architect` agent (subagent_type: architect) — Step 1
- `test-strategy` agent (subagent_type: test-strategy) — Step 2
- `test-builder` agent (subagent_type: test-builder) — Step 3 (skipped if tdd: false)
- `jira-workflow-manager` agent (subagent_type: jira-workflow-manager) — Step 4 (skipped if jira.enabled: false)
- `plan-management` skill — Step 5

**Followed by:**
- `executing-plans` skill

## Gotchas

1. This skill fires automatically after `writing-plans` — do not invoke it manually in Case A.
2. If architect returns NEEDS REVISION, update the plan doc and re-invoke architect — do not proceed to test-strategy until APPROVED.
3. Maximum 3 architect iterations — surface remaining BLOCKING issues to the user after the third pass.
4. `jira.enabled: false` and `workflow.tdd: false` are silent skips — no user-facing warning or confirmation prompt.
5. On the Jira-disabled path, omit `jira-key` from the `plan-management:created` call entirely — do not pass an empty string.
