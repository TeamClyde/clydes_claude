## Agents

Invoked via: `Agent { subagent_type: "<name>", prompt: "..." }`

| Agent | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|

| `test-runner` | ✅ | Post-implementation test executor. Mandates `systematic-debugging` on failure. |
| `infra-init-structure` | ✅ | Spawned by `infra-init` skill — no persistent agent file. |
| `infra-init-batch-indexer` | ✅ | Spawned by `infra-init` skill — no persistent agent file. |

## Rules

Load priority: rules override skills. Highest priority: `CLAUDE.md`.

| Rule file | Status | Governs |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` (global) | ✅ | Workflow sequence, delegation table, architect gate |
| `rules/workflow-phases.md` | ✅ | Jira + git phase sequence; two-source plan+journal sync (handoff is live pointer) |
| `rules/planning.md` | ✅ | Plan doc format, sizing, naming, architect gate sequence |
| `rules/plan-docs.md` | ✅ | When plan docs are created, location, skip conditions |
| `rules/filesystem/efficiency.md` | ✅ | Search/read patterns; plan-doc-first; graph tools over Grep |
| `rules/mcp-governance.md` | ✅ | MCP tool access; no direct Atlassian calls; JQL must include project filter |
| `rules/plugin-lifecycle.md` | ✅ | Plugin routing; Integrated plugins route via `creating-tools` |
| `rules/cspell.md` | ✅ | Spellcheck false positives; auto-add without asking |
| `rules/new-repo-setup.md` | ✅ | New repo checklist; CLAUDE.md template |
| `rules/integration-test-constraints.md` | ✅ | Integration test scope and constraint rules |

## Hooks

| Hook | Status | Trigger | What it does |
|------|--------|---------|--------------|
| `pre-commit` | ✅ | Before every git commit | Runs `scripts/run-tests.sh` (if executable); ESLint (if `.eslintrc` present); ruff (if `pyproject.toml` present); gitleaks (if installed). All checks skip gracefully if the tool is absent. |
